Changed functionality for importing event markers:


Option 1; File -> Import Events -> Load New Event Markers (and DELETE exisiting ones):
To load new markers from a text file and and DELETE the already existing ones.

You need a text-file with tab-separated columns and titles in the first row. You can use additional user-specified columns if you like and give them arbitrary titles.
You need at least the columns 'time' and 'nid', the rest is optional.
- 'time' --> time of event relative to first sample point in seconds (numeric)
- 'nid'  --> numeric ID of the marker indicating the experimental condition (integer) 
- 'name' --> name of the marker (string) 


Option 2; File -> Import Events -> Load New Event Markers (and KEEP exisiting ones):
To load new markers from a text file and KEEP the already existing ones.

You need a text-file with tab-separated columns and titles in the first row. You can use additional user-specified columns if you like and give them arbitrary titles.

- 'nid'  --> numeric ID of the marker indicating the experimental condition (integer) 
- 'name' --> name of the marker (string) 


Oprtion 3: File -> Import Events -> Recode Existing Events Markers
To recode existing markers from a text file with the same number of rows as there are existing markers.

You need a text-file with tab-separated columns and titles in the first row.  You can use additional user-specified columns if you like and give them arbitrary titles.
